Codes:
- For part 1 (8 point algorithm) -> the code is "Q1.m"
- For part 2 (ransac) and also rectification which is part 3 -> "Q2_and_Q3.m"
- For part 4 -> the code is "Q4.m"
- For part 5 (disparity) -> the code is "Q5.m"

I tried two different algorithms for implementing RANSAC (for more information refer to the report)
- ransac.m  * this is preferred*
- ransac1.m

I defined a function called "Ffinder.m", it finds the fundamental matrix based on the given features.



Results: 
*****For results please refer to the report that is attached.*****

However, you can find the rectified images in folder named "Part 3 - rectified_images"
I have also included some results of part 4 in the "Part 4 - depth" folder.
Part 5's results are in the report itseft.
